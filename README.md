# Pathfinder CR estimator

## Introduction
Pathfinder is a very popular and my personal favorite pen&paper RPG (Role-Playing Game). Frequent task and challenge for Game Masters (game designers and narrators) is monster creation, especially estimating monster power relative to level of players.

In this project I want to:
1. Create the dataset - use web scraper to gather monster statistics from [available site](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/) and parse it, making an easily usable .csv file.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - find answers e. g. to the following questions:
  - Are monster levels equally distributed?
  - Which monsters are outliers for their power levels? Which are too weak / too powerful?
  - Which statistics are correlated and how strong? How many can be automatically inferred for given levels?
3. CR estimator - create end-to-end platform, using machine learning models to help Game Masters estimate the power (Challenge Rating, CR) of their newly created monsters.

## Project progress and status
1. Dataset creation - in progress
2. EDA - TODO
3. Machine learning model - TODO
4. Deployment - TODO
